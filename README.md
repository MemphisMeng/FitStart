# FitStart


### Problem 
97% of BU students say they can live healthier. However they believe its difficult to build positive habits and behaviors for practicing healthy behavior. Health information is available but isnâ€™t necessarily helpful as students eat at the dining hall. COVID-19 has made these challenges even greater for the student body. They need friends/accompanies or other sources of motivation. 


### Solution 
FitStart utilizes Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) examined in context of a health promotion program through a digital app medium. Features based on 5 constructs known to influence health behavior:
- Knowledge
- Perceived Self-efficacy
- Outcome expectations
- Goal formation
- Sociocultural factors 


### Product 
FitStart is a fun and affordable way for college students to engage in the healthy lifestyle they deserve during their four years on Comm Ave. An excellent alternative to the hard to follow, unorganized, and unrealistic health information available online, FitStart offers their users a way to gamify healthy living amongst their peers. Users earn XP points and level up by accomplishing their personal goals, eating a healthier meal at the dining hall, and by completing their favorite work out. Students can add their friends and battle each other out to be the top of their social circle's FitStart leaderboard, bragging rights included.
